# CinemaRoom Rest Service
This is a simple Spring REST service that helps to manage a small movie theatre. 
Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

 It can:
  - return the information about the available seats;
  - allow customers to purchase tickets. Also it can handle some user mistakes.
  - allow customers to refund their tickets. Generate unique tokens to identify the ticket.
  - add the movie theater statistics and secure the endpoint with a password.
  
Pass me the popcorn, please :))
